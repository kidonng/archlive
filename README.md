# Archlive

A better Arch Linux Live/Rescue CD, built with [Archiso](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Archiso).

## Features

- `releng` profile based: familiar tools from official Arch Linux ISO
- KDE Plasma powered: say goodbye to daunting tty
- Mainland China users oriented: localized user interface, input method and multiple proxies
- Useful GUI applications added: system maintenance with ease
- Powerful CLI utilities included: supercharge your command line
- Various optimizations: TCP BBR, SysRq and many more

## Notes

- Default disk label is `ARCHLIVE`.
- Default user (`archlive`) is unprivileged as many services should not run as root.
- Default passwords are the same as usernames (`root` for `root`, `archlive` for `archlive`). `sudo` can be used without password.
